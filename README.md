# cannibalism
An analysis of cannibalism in soil food web models

The scripts here calculate the maximum rate of cannibalism for trophic species in a series of 16 soil food webs using their physiological parameters and compare these results to two sets of 15N data.

The script digitizedata.R was used to extract data the isotope data from Mieczan et al. 2015 publication plots.

The input data depends on the package soilfoodwebs, which is available on Github and downloaded in the script cannibalism.R
